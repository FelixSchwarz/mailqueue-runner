  # test with nose2: pyfakefs is not compatible with nose 1.3.7.
  # I experienced a test failure related to namespace packages:
  #    RuntimeError: 'path' must be None or a list, not <class '_frozen_importlib_external._NamespacePath'>
  # I could only remove the problem by switching to nose2 (even though I still
  # dislike its configuration bloat).
  - pip install --upgrade nose2
  # required so nose2 can execute tests inside the source tree
  - python setup.py develop
